# Facebook/D3/MEAN Stack Demo

This is a demo app cloned from the MEAN stack boilerplate. It contains demo code illustrating how to connect to a Facebook News Feed and use MongoDB aggregation queries to provide data for a D3 visualization. This code should be used for learning purposes only- for production use, it is highly recommended that you clone from the MEAN Stack git directly (https://github.com/linnovate/mean).
